Hello World!
Code whispers to life, Danilo
Fingers dance on keys and screens,
Dreams in every line.

Hello team
Thank you for the help
Good luck



Elegant and strong,
C# code flows like a river,
Logic weaves a song.


Gentle feet take flight,
Through the sunlit meadow green,
Rabbit dances light.
Goodbye world!
